📌 Title
Online Leave Management System (MERN Stack)
A web-based leave application and approval system for organizations with role-based access, holiday blocking, and real-time notifications.

📝 Description
The Online Leave Management System is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows employees to apply for leaves, view their leave history, and track approvals. Managers can view, approve, or reject leave requests, while the system automatically prevents applications on predefined holidays.

This project aims to streamline the leave process within an organization with a user-friendly interface and real-time notification support.
